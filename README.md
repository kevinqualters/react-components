* [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) Application architecture for building user interfaces
* [Require](http://requirejs.org/) JavaScript file and module loader optimized for in-browser use
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs) JavaScript utility library
* [Moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) Fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [d3](http://d3js.org/) Manipulate documents based on data with Data-Driven Documents

##### Style

* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) Css authoring framework
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with superpowers

##### Unit testing and style checking

* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html) Behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code
* [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) JavaScript statement, line, function, and branch code coverage when running unit tests
* [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) Detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and enforce your team's coding conventions
* [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) JavaScript Code Style checker

#### Install Dependencies

##### Node

[node.js.org](nodejs.org)

##### Bower

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

##### Compass & Sass

```
$ gem install compass
```

##### Grunt command line interface

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

##### React tools

```
$ npm install -g react-tools
```

##### Finally, install third-party dependencies and start watchers:

```
$ cd ~/path/to/react-components/root
$ grunt init
```

#### Bower link react-components to work locally
```
$ cd ~/path/to/react-components/root
$ bower link
$ cd ~/path/to/project/root
$ bower link react-components
```

NPM Troubles? npm ERR! Are you seeing something like: `Error: EACCES, mkdir '/Users/user/.npm/dargs/2.1.0'` ?
Try the following commands and try the previous step again:

```
$ cd ~
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami) .npm
```

If you find your css build results are empty, update your sass gem.

#### Use the sample app in your browser to develop

> /react-components/src/js/examples/index.html

### Grunt Tasks

The default grunt task will compile jsx and scss files as well as start a watcher for them.

```
$ grunt
```

Same as the default grunt task, however it will reinstall dependencies.

```
$ grunt init
```

Run Jasmine unit tests, JSHint, and JSCS.

```
$ grunt test
```

Run Jasmine unit tests on a single file.

```
$ grunt jasmine --filter filename
```

Same as grunt test, however, this task will run code coverage and launch the code coverage in your browser.

```
$ grunt test:cov
```
